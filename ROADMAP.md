# 📍 GAIFARE Roadmap

**GAIFARE** (Generative AI for Autonomous Renewable Energy) is an open source initiative under the LF Energy ORES working group. This roadmap outlines our phased development strategy for building a scalable, intelligent, and software-defined energy orchestration framework using generative AI.

---

## ✅ Phase 0: Ideation & Community Formation *(Q2 2025)*

- [x] Define project scope and vision under ORES
- [x] Draft project README, and initial materials
- [x] Launch GitHub repo
- [ ] Landscape scan of existing standards, models, and AI agent frameworks
- [ ] Present at [LF Energy Summit](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/lfenergysummit-europe/) & recruit contributors (Chris, Karl, Pierre, Emilio, Holger, etc)

---

## 🚧 Phase 1: Architecture & Simulation Prototype *(Q3–Q4 2025)*

- [ ] Define reference architecture for AI-enabled software-defined EMS
- [ ] Design metadata schema and device ontology (e.g. based on SAREF, EEBus)
- [ ] Implement agent framework prototype (e.g., in Python/Node.js/Go)
- [ ] Create a simulation sandbox with 3–5 virtual devices (e.g., fridge, battery, EV)
- [ ] Establish basic negotiation logic and learning loop
- [ ] Publish draft GAIFARE Agent Protocol v0.1

---

## 🚀 Phase 2: Real-Time Coordination Engine *(Q1–Q2 2026)*

- [ ] Integrate cloud-native backend (Kubernetes-based or serverless)
- [ ] Add scheduling agents for demand-response and time-of-use pricing scenarios
- [ ] Extend protocol to support peer-to-peer contracts
- [ ] Implement weather/price forecast integration via open APIs
- [ ] Add dashboard for visualization and simulation control

---

## 🔄 Phase 3: Interoperability & Real-World Pilots *(Q3–Q4 2026)*

- [ ] Integrate with Home Assistant or OpenHAB for real-device simulation
- [ ] Collaborate with academic or industry partners for pilot deployment
- [ ] Align protocol with ORES and LF Energy standards
- [ ] Formalize agent security and trust models
- [ ] Publish GAIFARE Agent Protocol v1.0

---

## 🧠 Future Opportunities

- Natural language interfaces for user-agent interaction
- Federated learning for multi-home coordination
- Integration with decentralized identity (DID) and blockchain-based energy tokens
- Open marketplace for AI-powered energy agent extensions
