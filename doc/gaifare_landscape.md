# GAIFARE Landscape Scan: Related Projects and Initiatives

This document provides a working overview of initiatives similar to **GAIFARE (Generative AI for Autonomous Renewable Energy)** for discussion and collaborative input. The goal is to identify overlaps, gaps, and collaboration opportunities as GAIFARE develops under LF Energy’s ORES working group.

## Gaps GAIFARE Intends to Fill

- Open source, LLM-compatible **energy agent framework**
- Designed for **home/microgrid-scale autonomy**
- Supports real-time **negotiation, scheduling, and reasoning**
- Integrates **forecasting + peer-to-peer coordination**
- Aligns with **cloud-native and software-defined energy systems**
