**GAIFARE: Generative AI for Autonomous Renewable Energy**

**An Open Source Initiative under LF Energy ORES**

**üß≠ Project Mission**

GAIFARE (Generative AI for Autonomous Renewable Energy) is an open initiative to build a generative AI-powered framework for intelligent, decentralized, and self-organizing energy systems. Under the LF Energy ORES umbrella, GAIFARE empowers households, devices, and microgrids to act as autonomous energy agents‚Äîcoordinating production, storage, and consumption through real-time learning, reasoning, and negotiation.

**üéØ Objectives**

* **Develop AI-based agents** to orchestrate household energy behavior, including load shifting, storage optimization, and coordination with grid signals.  
* **Create a simulation platform** for modeling decentralized energy networks, enabling safe prototyping of autonomous energy interactions.  
* **Standardize metadata schemas and open APIs** for describing device capabilities, energy contracts, and circuit-level constraints.  
* **Ensure safety and regulatory alignment** by building simulation-first systems that respect existing physical limitations and codes.

**üõ°Ô∏è Safety Commitment**

GAIFARE does not promote physical implementation of bidirectional energy flow on traditional household AC circuits. All autonomous energy operations will be conducted in simulation or through code-compliant, isolated, and supervised hardware. Software agents must incorporate circuit-aware planning to prevent unsafe conditions.

The gaifare-safety module will support this by:

* Modeling maximum circuit capacity and directionality  
* Enforcing virtual energy contracts based on safe circuit topologies  
* Enabling predictive safety mechanisms through AI planning  
* Defining requirements for future safe hardware integrations (e.g., smart panels, DC buses, solid-state breakers)

**ü§ù Community & Collaboration**

GAIFARE welcomes contributors, researchers, device makers, and standards bodies to co-create a trusted digital energy future. Potential partners include:

* LF Energy projects (e.g., Grid eXchange Fabric, Shapeshifter)  
* OpenHAB, Home Assistant  
* IEEE P2030.x series  
* Energy Web Foundation  
* Smart panel vendors (e.g., SPAN, Lumin) and hardware startups
