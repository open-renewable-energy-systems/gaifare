# GAIFARE: Generative AI for Autonomous Renewable Energy

**GAIFARE** is an open source project under the [LF Energy ORES Working Group](https://lfenergy.org/projects/ores-open-renewable-energy-systems/) umbrella, incubated by the [ORES (Open Renewable Energy Systems)](https://lfenergy.org/projects/ores/) working group. GAIFARE aims to build a **generative AI-powered framework** for intelligent, decentralized, and self-organizing energy systems.

As battery and renewable technologies evolve, GAIFARE focuses on enabling the next generation of energy agents—capable of learning, reasoning, and negotiating power usage autonomously across households, devices, and microgrids.

## 🌎 Vision

To empower every device, appliance, and home to become an intelligent energy node—participating in a self-optimizing, AI-driven network that maximizes sustainability, efficiency, and energy sovereignty.

---

## 💡 What GAIFARE Provides

- **Reference Architecture** for intelligent, AI-powered home energy networks
- **Open Standards** for device metadata, agent protocols, and negotiation interfaces
- **Software Agent Frameworks** for autonomous energy orchestration
- **Simulation Tools** to test multi-agent behavior in energy coordination
- **Integrations** with ORES software-defined EMS and cloud-native orchestration layers

---

## 📦 Use Cases

- Autonomous scheduling of appliance energy use based on weather, pricing, and grid load
- Peer-to-peer energy negotiation between devices (e.g. EVs, fridges, batteries)
- Federated learning across homes for collaborative optimization
- Explainable AI-powered energy decisions in human-friendly language

---

## 🧠 Built On

- **ORES** software-defined EMS architecture  
- **Cloud-native tools** like Kubernetes, gRPC, and Prometheus  
- **Generative AI models** (e.g. LLMs, planners) for agent logic  
- **Standards** from SAREF, OpenADR, Matter, and EEBus as inspiration
